<p align="center">Color Space Editing with OpenCV and PyQt6</p>
<hr>

## Description
This project demonstrates a simple application that allows users to adjust color space parameters using sliders in a PyQt6 graphical user interface (GUI), while simultaneously displaying the live video stream from a webcam with the applied color space filtering.

<hr>

## Requirements
- Python 3.6.0 or more
- OpenCV (cv2) library
- PyQt6 library
<hr>

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```shell
   pip install opencv-python PyQt6
2. Save the provided code in a file named main.py.
3. Run the program using the following command:
   ```shell
   python main.py
   ``` 
    This will launch the Color Space Editing application.
4. Adjust the sliders to modify the color space parameters.
5. The live video stream from the webcam will be displayed in the "Webcam Stream" window. The color space filtering will be applied to the video stream, and the resulting filtered video will be displayed in the "result" window.
6. To exit the application, click the "Exit" button or press the 'q' key while the video stream window is active.
